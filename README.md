Qwen3-VL ComfyUI Node Suite (High Performance)
A unified, production-grade ComfyUI node suite for Qwen3-VL Vision-Language models.
This suite has been re-engineered for reliability, speed, and ease of use. It features a Unified Loader that automatically handles both standard Transformers (High Precision) and GGUF (Low VRAM/High Speed) models, along with powerful image management tools.
🚀 Key Features
🛡️ Unified Backend Support
⦁	Auto-Detect: The loader automatically identifies if a model is GGUF or Transformers based on the file/folder selected.
⦁	Transformers: Full support for 4-bit/8-bit bitsandbytes quantization and Flash Attention 2.
⦁	GGUF: Native llama-cpp-python integration for running 8B+ models on consumer GPUs (6GB-8GB VRAM) or Apple Silicon.
📦 Dedicated Model Manager
⦁	GUI-Based Management: Download, Check Status, or Remove models directly from ComfyUI using the Model Manager node.
⦁	JSON Config: All model URLs and settings are defined in qwen_models.json for easy updates.
🖼️ Advanced Image Handling
⦁	Directory Scanning: The Image Loader can scan entire local folders, filter by name, and cycle through images by index.
⦁	History System: Remembers your recently used folders for quick access.
⦁	Smart Rescaling: Dedicated Image Rescaler ensures optimal resolution matching for VLM inputs.
🛠️ Production Ready
⦁	Logging: Detailed operation logs saved to logs/qwen3_vl.log.
⦁	CUDA Safety: Strict VRAM cleanup, garbage collection, and OOM protection.
⦁	Prompt Engineering: Built-in "Thinking", "Describe", and "Analyze" presets.
📥 Installation
Method 1: Manual (Recommended)
1.	Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:  
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
2.	Clone this repository:  
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/ComfyUI-Qwen3-VL.git](https://github.com/yourusername/ComfyUI-Qwen3-VL.git)  
cd ComfyUI-Qwen3-VL
3.	Install Dependencies:
⦁	Windows (Portable):  
..\..\..\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
⦁	Linux / Mac / Venv:  
pip install -r requirements.txt
[!NOTE]  
For GGUF support on NVIDIA GPUs, ensure llama-cpp-python is compiled with CUDA support. If pre-built wheels fail, refer to the llama-cpp-python documentation.
📂 Folder Structure
The nodes expect models in specific directories inside your ComfyUI models folder.  
Logs and Configs are stored inside the custom node folder.

🧩 Node Overview
1. Management & Loading
RM-Qwen3-VL Model Manager
⦁	Role: Your control center for model files.
⦁	Inputs:
⦁	model_name: Select from a predefined list (starred items * are not yet installed).
⦁	action: Download (fetches from HF), Check Status, or Remove (deletes local files).
⦁	Note: Supports both GGUF (files) and Transformers (folders) downloading.
Qwen3-VL Loader (GGUF + HF)
⦁	Role: The universal model loader.
⦁	Inputs:
⦁	model: Select any installed model. The node auto-detects the backend.
⦁	quantization: For Transformers models (4bit/8bit/None).
⦁	gpu_layers_gguf: For GGUF models (-1 = Offload All to GPU).
2. Image Tools
RM-Qwen3-VL Image Loader
⦁	Role: A powerful alternative to the standard "Load Image" node.
⦁	Features:
⦁	Directory Scan: Point it to a folder (directory) to load images sequentially.
⦁	Quick Select: Dropdown menu remembers your last 15 used paths.
⦁	Filtering: Use filter to find specific filenames (e.g., "landscape").
⦁	Indexing: Use index to cycle through images in a folder.
RM-Qwen3-VL Image Rescaler
⦁	Role: Prepares images for the VLM.
⦁	Features: Resizes images to standard resolutions (e.g., 1024x1024) while maintaining aspect ratio and ensuring dimensions are divisible by the model's patch size (default modulo 16/32).
3. Inference
RM-Qwen3-VL Run
⦁	Role: The main brain. Generates text from images.
⦁	Inputs:
⦁	caption_type: Choose presets like "Descriptive", "Thinking" (for COT models), "Danbooru Tags", or "JSON".
⦁	prompt_mode: Prepend your custom prompt or Overwrite the system prompt.
⦁	system_prompt: Fully customizable system instructions.
⦁	boolean flags: Toggles for specific tasks (e.g., "Read Text", "Analyze Lighting", "Describe Clothing").
⚠️ Common Issues & Troubleshooting
1. "RuntimeError: CUDA Out of memory"
⦁	Transformers: Use the Loader to set quantization to 4bit.
⦁	GGUF: Reduce n_ctx (context size) or use a smaller quantization file (e.g., Q4_K_S).
⦁	General: Enable unload_when_done in the Run node.
2. "GGUF Model missing mmproj file"
⦁	Cause: GGUF models require a separate "Vision Projector" file (usually named mmproj-....gguf).
⦁	Fix: Use the Model Manager node to download the GGUF model; it automatically fetches the required mmproj file defined in qwen_models.json.
3. "No models found"
⦁	Fix: Connect the Model Manager node, select a model, set action to Download, and run the queue once.
4. Logs & Debugging
⦁	Check custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Qwen3-VL/logs/qwen3_vl.log for detailed error messages and download progress.
